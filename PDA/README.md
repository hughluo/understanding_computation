# Pushdown Automata

A pushdown auotmaton is a finite state machine with a buil-in stack.

DFA cannot solve the problem such as "balancing brackets" cause a finite automaton must always have a finite number of states, so for any given machine, there is always a finite limit to how many levels of nesting it can support (it cannot keep track of an arbitray amount of information).
