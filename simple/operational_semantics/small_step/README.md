# Small-Step Semantics

* Iterative flavour
* An abstract machine that maintains some execution state, define reduction rules and specify how each kind of program construct can make incremental progress toward being fully evaluated.
* Slicing up the complex business of executing an program into smalller pieces by reducing.
* Reducing an expression and an environment return a new expression, the old environment could be reused.
* Reducing a statement and an environment return a new statement and a new environment.
